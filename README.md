# Symphony Plus

Symphony Plus extends [OpenAI Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony) with optional, durable
GitHub comment-driven workflow control and support for orchestrating repository-local Spec Kit
phases. It retains Symphony's isolated, autonomous implementation model so teams can manage work
instead of supervising coding agents.

_In this [demo video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1186371009?h=5626e4b899), Symphony monitors a Linear board for work and spawns agents to handle the tasks. The agents complete the tasks and provide proof of work: CI status, PR review feedback, complexity analysis, and walkthrough videos. When accepted, the agents land the PR safely. Engineers do not need to supervise Codex; they can manage the work at a higher level._

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony is a low-key engineering preview for testing in trusted environments.

## Running Symphony

### Requirements

Symphony works best in codebases that have adopted
[harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/). Symphony is the next step --
moving from managing coding agents to managing work that needs to get done.

### Option 1. Make your own

Tell your favorite coding agent to build Symphony in a programming language of your choice:

> Implement Symphony according to the following spec:
> https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md

### Option 2. Use our experimental reference implementation

Check out [elixir/README.md](elixir/README.md) for instructions on how to set up your environment
and run the Elixir-based Symphony implementation. You can also ask your favorite coding agent to
help with the setup:

> Set up Symphony Plus for my repository based on
> https://github.com/rohanyupadhyay/symphony-plus/blob/main/elixir/README.md

For a complete agent-operated installation in a Spec Kit repository, use the
[AI-agent installation runbook](elixir/docs/agent-installation.md). See
[GitHub workflow control](elixir/docs/github-workflow-control.md) for the protocol and security
model. Each operator creates and owns a private App; Symphony Plus never ships or hosts a shared
private key. Target repositories should keep their workflow and operator guide together as
`.symphony/WORKFLOW.md` and `.symphony/README.md`; this tool-owned directory is the documented
Symphony Plus convention.
