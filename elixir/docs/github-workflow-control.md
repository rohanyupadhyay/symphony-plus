# GitHub workflow control

GitHub workflow control is an optional layer for workflows that need durable questions, approval
gates, and pull-request review loops. GitHub issues are the human interface; Symphony's dashboard
continues to show runtime execution and logs.

To onboard a Spec Kit repository with an AI coding agent, follow the
[agent installation runbook](agent-installation.md). It covers host setup, local Spec Kit
verification, workflow customization, App registration, startup, restart recovery, and a
disposable end-to-end smoke test. This document defines the underlying protocol and operations.

## Configure it

```yaml
tracker:
  kind: github
  provider:
    repo: owner/repository
    auth:
      kind: github_app
      app_id: $GITHUB_APP_ID
      installation_id: $GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID
      private_key_path: $GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
    workflow_control:
      enabled: true
      authorized_associations:
        - OWNER
        - MEMBER
        - COLLABORATOR
  required_labels: [symphony]
  active_states: [open]
  terminal_states: [closed]
```

The feature is disabled by default. Authorized associations may contain only `OWNER`, `MEMBER`,
and `COLLABORATOR`; comments from all other human associations are ignored for control purposes.
The configured App's exact `Bot` identity may author checkpoint markers, but it can never answer a
question or approve its own work. Existing authorized human-authored markers remain valid.

Build Symphony and run the guided App setup. GitHub opens a prefilled private-App registration page
requesting Contents, Issues, Pull requests, and Workflows write access, with webhooks disabled.
After registering the App, generate and download a private key, install the App on the target
repository, and enter the App and installation IDs when prompted:

```bash
./bin/symphony github-app setup owner/repository --profile default
./bin/symphony github-app verify owner/repository --profile default
./scripts/run-github --app-profile default /absolute/path/to/repository/.symphony/WORKFLOW.md --port 4000
```

For repository-local GitHub/Spec Kit workflows, Symphony Plus recommends this visible contract:

```text
.symphony/
├── README.md
└── WORKFLOW.md
```

`WORKFLOW.md` is the executable configuration and agent prompt. `README.md` is the operator guide
for startup, commands, workspace locations, and repository-specific policy. Link the guide from the
repository's root README so contributors can discover the otherwise hidden tool directory. This is
a Symphony Plus repository convention, not a GitHub or Spec Kit requirement; the launcher still
accepts any explicit workflow path.

Profiles are stored under
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/symphony-plus/github-apps/<profile>/`. Directories use mode `0700`;
the copied key and `profile.json` use `0600`. The key never belongs in Symphony Plus, a target
repository, or an issue workspace. To rotate a key, generate a replacement in GitHub, create and
verify a new profile name, switch the launcher to it, and then revoke the old key. To add another
repository in the same owner account, update the App installation's repository selection and run
`verify` for that repository; use another profile when GitHub assigns another installation ID.

The launcher exports only the App ID, installation ID, and private-key path to the Symphony host.
Symphony generates short-lived installation tokens, refreshes them before expiry, and removes App
and PAT environment variables from Codex. App comments, labels, PRs, and pushes appear as the
operator-chosen `<app-slug>[bot]` identity. No shared Symphony Plus App or hosted token service
exists.

For legacy PAT operation, omit `auth`, retain `token: $GITHUB_TOKEN`, authenticate `gh`, and launch
without `--app-profile`:

```bash
gh auth login
./scripts/run-github /absolute/path/to/repository/.symphony/WORKFLOW.md --port 4000
```

The reusable Spec Kit workflow template uses `danger-full-access` for its Codex thread and turns.
This is required because Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox intentionally makes `.git` read-only,
while this workflow must create branches, commit artifacts, and push them. Keep `workspace.root`
pointed at a dedicated Symphony workspace tree; never point it at a developer checkout. The setting
applies to Symphony's issue agents, not to unrelated Codex sessions.

With App authentication, Symphony configures each local issue workspace's commit author to the App
bot and disables inherited Git credential helpers. Agents commit locally and call
`github_git_push`; the host verifies the issue workspace, branch, head SHA, clean tree, and remote
before pushing. App-authenticated pushes intentionally reject SSH workers in this first release.

## Checkpoints and commands

Agents call `github_workflow_checkpoint` with a state, phase, and readable summary. Conditional
fields are `prompt`, `gate`, `branch`, `head_sha`, and `pr_number`. Approval checkpoints require a
40-character pushed commit SHA and branch whose current GitHub head matches that SHA. Review
checkpoints record the current PR conversation, inline-comment, and formal-review IDs so old events
are not handled twice.

`review_pending` is the automatic managed-PR handoff. It requires `phase=review`, the PR number,
the exact same-repository branch, and its 40-character pushed head. Before posting the checkpoint,
the host validates that PR identity and head, adds the configured required label idempotently, and
only then records the checkpoint. The next successful poll enriches the issue with the PR,
conversation, inline comments, formal reviews, and all current-head check runs/statuses, then
dispatches the originating issue workspace without another human command. Forks, cross-repository
heads, removed labels, stale heads, closed/merged PRs, and incomplete review context do not dispatch.

For Spec Kit workflows, each readable checkpoint summary is also the operator's audit trail. It
must name every phase actually invoked, the current checkpoint and next phase, question counts and
zero-question reasons, material assumptions, analyze and convergence cycle counts, validation, and
omissions. Phases must be reported separately; a broad label such as “planning” must not hide
whether `clarify`, `checklist`, or `analyze` ran. The reusable template contains the canonical
`Spec Kit progress` format.

Supported commands are:

```text
/symphony approve spec
/symphony approve plan
/symphony approve implementation
/symphony revise [spec|plan|implementation] <instructions>
/symphony retry
/symphony status
/symphony cancel
```

A direct authorized comment resumes only an `awaiting_input` checkpoint. Approval commands must
match the current gate. General issue and PR comments are context, not triggers. Formal requested
changes, formal approval, PR merge/closure, and explicit PR commands can resume an
`awaiting_review` checkpoint. An unresolved change request from any current reviewer takes
precedence over approvals from other reviewers.

Removing the required label makes the issue ineligible immediately. Closing the issue makes it
terminal. The workflow prompt remains responsible for applying `/symphony cancel` by removing the
label, and for closing the issue after a merged PR.

## Pull request tracking

Every pull request created or updated by the reusable GitHub Spec Kit workflow includes exactly one
plain `Tracks #<issue-number>` line in its template-compliant body. GitHub autolinks that
same-repository reference and presents a reciprocal cross-reference on the issue. Updates, retries,
and revisions preserve the existing line instead of appending another relationship.

The tracking line must not use GitHub's closing keywords (`close`, `fix`, or `resolve` and their
variants). The relationship therefore does not close the issue when the pull request is merged or
closed. Issue closure remains a separate workflow responsibility: a merged pull request is handled
explicitly, while a pull request closed without merge leaves the issue open for a revise, replace,
or cancel decision.

## Recovery and API usage

The latest authorized hidden marker is reconstructed from GitHub comments on every relevant poll,
so restarts need no Symphony database. One issue keeps its existing workspace across phases.

Only issues carrying all configured required labels are enriched. A waiting issue requires its
issue-comment pages to be read each poll. PR endpoints are queried for `review_pending` and
`awaiting_review`; required-context retrieval failure fails the atomic issue fetch rather than
dispatching with partial evidence.
Repositories with many simultaneously labeled issues should increase `polling.interval_ms` and
monitor GitHub rate-limit headers. This implementation uses polling, not webhooks.

This feature does not install GitHub Spec Kit extensions or create one GitHub issue per Spec Kit
task. A repository workflow may invoke its existing local Spec Kit skills while retaining a single
parent GitHub issue.

## Troubleshooting

- `missing_github_app_*`: rerun the launcher with the intended `--app-profile` and verify the
  profile files still exist.
- `insecure_github_app_private_key_permissions`: change the copied PEM to mode `0600`.
- HTTP `403`: confirm the App installation includes the repository and has Contents, Issues, Pull
  requests, and Workflows write access. Permission changes must be approved on the installation.
- `github_push_*_mismatch`: inspect the current workspace branch, local `HEAD`, origin URL, and
  uncommitted files; the host tool does not force-push or repair ambiguous state.
- `github_app_push_unsupported_on_ssh_worker`: use a local workspace or the legacy external
  credential path until remote App secret brokering is implemented.
